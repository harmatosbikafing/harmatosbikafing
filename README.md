Hi stranger, welcome to the circ... i mean, welcome to harmatosbikafing's github page.

I'm a 19 years old Hungarian guy who is interested in programming and web development. My birthday is in 7th June.<br>
My hometown is GyÅ‘r, which is in northwest Hungary and the capital of GyÅ‘r-Moson-Sopron county.<br>
My goal is to settle down in a job which contains programming. ðŸ¤”<br>
In the current situation, I only know HTML and CSS, but if I have free time after school, I'm trying to improve my skills or knowledge about that. :angel:<br>
